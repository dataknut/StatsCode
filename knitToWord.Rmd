# Knitting to MS Word

...does not always go according to plan...

This is a table which we'd like as a prettified `kableExtra::` table...

```{r testKableExtra}
df <- mtcars
library(kableExtra)

kableExtra::kable(df, caption = "mtcars table") %>%
  kable_styling()

```

But we can use

 * library(flextable)
 * library(officer)

See https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/flextable/vignettes/overview.html

```{r testKableExtra}

library(flextable)
library(officer)

myft <- flextable(
  head(df), 
  col_keys = c("am", "carb", "gear", "mpg", "drat" ))

myft

```

# nomisr

An R interface to UK Census data via [nomis](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/api/v01/help). For more info see:

 * https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nomisr/index.html
 * https://github.com/ropensci/nomisr
 * Citation - [@nomisr]
 
This code also uses data.table [@data.table].

# Get full list of tables

nomisr provides various ways to search the tables list but it is a bit easier on the API to get the list as a data table and then search it locally...


```r
nomisTablesDT <- as.data.table(nomis_data_info())

knitr::kable(caption = paste0("List of first 5 NOMIS tables (of ", nrow(nomisTablesDT)), head(nomisTablesDT, 5))

So we can get OAs & LSOAs etc.

Get the data at local authority level... lower levels of geography generate time-outs on the API if we do not have a key.

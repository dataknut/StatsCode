# StatsCode

A place to keep code snippets and examples of analysis methods so I don't have to go rummaging through other code to find them.

I'm currently working through many of the packages listed [here](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2921176/business-intelligence/great-r-packages-for-data-import-wrangling-visualization.html). So should you.

Highlights:

 * OLS [regression reporting](olsRegressionExample.html)
 * [References](ReferencesInRmd.html) in Rmd
 * [Mapping things](mapping.html) in Rmd

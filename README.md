#StatsCode

A place to keep code snippets and examples of analysis methods so we don't have to go rummaging through other code to find them.

We're currently working through many of the packages listed [here](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2921176/business-intelligence/great-r-packages-for-data-import-wrangling-visualization.html). So should you.

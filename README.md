# StatsCode

A place to keep code snippets and examples of analysis methods so I don't have to go rummaging through other code to find them.

I'm currently working through many of the packages listed [here](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2921176/business-intelligence/great-r-packages-for-data-import-wrangling-visualization.html). So should you.

_Highlights_ (best viewed via [pages](https://dataknut.github.io/statsCode/)):

 * OLS [regression reporting](olsRegressionExample.html) my way
 * [References](ReferencesInRmd.html) in Rmd
 * [Mapping stuff](mapping.html) in Rmd
 * [Colour blind pallettes](cbPalettes.html) in Rmd
 * The incredibly useful [drake](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/):
   * [drake.R](drake.R) - R script with drake function calls
   * [drake.Rmd](drake.Rmd) - Rmd code called by drake (in R) to create report
   * [drake.html](drake.html) - the report
